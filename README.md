# CDA5106-Branch-Prediction
CDA5106 UCF Spring 25 Final Project

Installation:

Install all the required libraries using `pip -r requirements.txt`. This code was written in Python 3.10.

Trace Generation:

Before the model can be trained, the traces must be generated by using `trace_processing.py`. The script will output `.pt` files, one for each trace. 

The original .pt files are not submitted as they were each very large (> 6 GB). If you wish to replicate the results, you must generate these files yourself. NOTE THIS TAKES A VERY LONG TIME, AT LEAST 45 MINUTES, IF NOT LONGER FOR ALL TRACES.

Once these files are generated, move the traces used for training into `traces/train`, the traces used for validation into `traces/valid`, and any leftover traces into `traces/unused`

Training:

The model training script is `sim_ml.py`. This automatically performs training and saves the best model based on the validation set. 

Evaluation:

The model evaluation script is `evaluate.py`. This automatically performs the model evaluation based on the models saved in the `models` directory.

Plotting:

`plotting.ipynb` contains the plotting code used to generate the plots of the misprediction rates. Plots are generated based off logs recorded in the `logs` directory.
